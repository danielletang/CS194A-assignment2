## Notes

For some reason, I had a lot of trouble getting any of the less straightforward extensions going.
I tried a few of the suggested extensions and each step of the way, something would be wrong with
the syntax where the app would crash every time I ran it. If I'd started earlier on the assignment
I'm sure these issues would have been easily resolved at office hours, but instead I just spent a
lot of time last-minute Googling errors. Oh well! I was able to get a couple aesthetic changes in.
If I had more time on this assignment, future extensions I really want to do are:
* prompt the user to save the map if they exit the map creation screen without saving
* the ability to edit a map once it's already saved
* a more intuitive way to delete a pin rather than just clicking its description box
I'll be sure to start earlier on the last assignment!
